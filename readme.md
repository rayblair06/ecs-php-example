A simple PHP server example for ECS deployment

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [PHP](https://www.php.com)

## Installation

### _Development_

Follow the steps below to build and start the PHP server.

Generate environment variables.
```
cp .env.example .env
```

Build Docker image and start Docker container.
```
make build
make start
```

## ECS Setup

- Create Repo in ECR.
- Create Cluster in ECS (We will be working mostly in there from now on).
- Create Task Definition.
- Get JSON of Task Definition and place within repo.
- Create Service within Cluster with Task Definition
	- Optionally create a load balancer to resolve as task ip constantly changes.
	- Note: Makesure to specify the ECS network as network, it seems to default to a random VPN sometimes.
- Update `deploy.yml` workflow with information created above.

```
env:
  AWS_REGION: eu-west-2                             # set this to your preferred AWS region, e.g. eu-west-2
  ECR_REPOSITORY: ecs-php-example                   # set this to your Amazon ECR repository name
  ECS_SERVICE: ecs-php-example                      # set this to your Amazon ECS service name
  ECS_CLUSTER: default                              # set this to your Amazon ECS cluster name
  ECS_TASK_DEFINITION: .aws/task-definition.json    # set this to the path to your Amazon ECS task definition
                                                    # file, e.g. .aws/task-definition.json
  CONTAINER_NAME: ecs-php-example                   # set this to the name of the container in the
                                                    # containerDefinitions section of your task definition
```
